                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Science is an enterprise that should be cherished as an activity of the free human
                    mind. Because it transforms who we are, how we live, and it gives us an understanding of our place
                    in the universe.</p>
                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The universe is large and old, and the ingredients for life as we know it are
                    everywhere, so there's no reason to think that Earth would be unique in that regard. Whether of not
                    the life became intelligent is a different question, and we'll see if we find that.</p>
                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">If you get asteroids about a kilometer in size, those are large enough and carry
                    enough energy into our system to disrupt transportation, communication, the food chains, and that
                    can be a really bad day on Earth.</p>
                <div>
                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">I have odd cosmic thoughts every day</h2>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For me, the most fascinating interface is Twitter. I have odd cosmic thoughts
                        every
                        day and I realized I could hold them to myself or share them with people who might be
                        interested.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect. I kind of want to know what happened
                        there
                        because we're twirling knobs here on Earth without knowing the consequences of it. Mars once had
                        running water. It's bone dry today. Something bad happened there as well.</p>
